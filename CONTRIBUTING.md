Following these guidelines helps to communicate that you respect the time of the maintainers managing and developing this project. In return, they should reciprocate that respect in addressing your issue, assessing changes, and helping you finalize your pull requests.

## Did you find a bug?

A bug is a demonstrable problem that is caused by the code in the repository. Good bug reports are extremely helpful - thank you!

Guidelines for bug reports:

-   Ensure the bug was not already reported by searching on GitHub under [Issues][].

-   If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, open a [new issue][] using the _Bug report_ template. Fill in as much relevant information as possible, adding a **code sample**, **screenshot/gif** capture, or an **executable test case** demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

## Do you intend to add a new feature or change an existing one?

Guidelines for features:

-   Ensure the feature request was not already reported by searching on GitHub under [Issues][].

## Did you write a patch that fixes a bug or implements a feature?

-   Make the change in your own private [fork][] of the project.

-   Open a new GitHub pull request with the patch.
